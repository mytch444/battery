battery
=======
Prints out the status of your battery. Percentage and its state.

lowbatteryd
===========
Simple daemon that check the percentage of your battery and gives you warnings through notify-send.

It is probably best to add this to your .xinitrc file and not as a init script like I was trying to for a while there.
